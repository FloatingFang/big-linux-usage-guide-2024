# About
This is an W.I.P guide for BigLinux. a brazilian Manjaro/Arch-based distro, that focuses on bringing innovation in way of faster, secure, and hassle free.

I am covering the KDE version, there are community versions of GNOME and XFCE, both are maintained by community and not officially supported by the Big Linux Team

# Install Process
After booting the ISO, and choosing whether you want proprietary or open source drivers, and choosing your preferred language and keyboard along with it, and your favorite theme/layout (there is the MacOS/Gnome theme, WinMac, Classic Windows, and a which reflects Canonical's Unity, both are very modern themes), and now on the starting desktop, click on the installer and follow the steps, which is Calamares, and play some Atari PingPong while you wait

# Post-Installation
Now that you have installed it, make the updates in the Terminal (Konole) and type:
# sudo pacman -Syyu
If you fail to synchronize the database
# sudo pamac update --force-refresh
Reboot and see if everything is ok on your system, if everything goes well, you will be ready to try the system, and explore everything it has to offer, both the webapps included, the cool backgrounds, and finally play, besides, look the Big Store if you want to install browsers, emulators/games, newsreaders, RSS, and I recommend that you explore the Big Control Center, which is the most advanced control center we have

# Gaming/Steam/Lutris/Retroarch
Both are installed by default, Steam just click and wait for it to update, Lutris is recommended to download Wine or Proton, and then make the settings you want
Big Linux is already very prepared for games, with the possibility of installing Retroarch for installation and playing old games in the BigStore, with a simplifier right there, and because it is Arch/Manjaro based, you have new technologies

# Exploring the OS
You have webapps, from webapps from Google, to most common services, as this focus on simplicity, and all of these apps surprinsingly doesn't pass from 50+ MB on total, so enjoy them
You have an microphone background sound decreaser, good enough, right?
You have VLC as default
You have Big Store, which for me, is one of the best stores ever created for an system, which integrates the AUR, Natives, Flatpaks, and Snaps, with possibility of integrating .deb and .rpm (WOW)

#Customization
The Big Linux's KDE feels more consistent and unique, so dont fear to learn the new KDE styling, here is an screenshot of my BigLinux install
