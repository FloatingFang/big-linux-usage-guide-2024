# About
This is an W.I.P guide for BigLinux. a braziliain Manjaro/Arch-based distro, that focus on bringing innovation in way of faster, secure, and hassle free 

I am covering the KDE version, there are community versions of GNOME and XFCE, both are maintained by community and not officially supported by the Big Linux Team

# Install Process
After booting the ISO and choosing if you want proprietary or open source drivers, choose your preferred language and keyboard, and layout/theme (there are many that reflects MacOS/Gnome, Macdows, and Classic Windows and Ubuntu in a Unity style) and forward to the desktop enviroment
Booted? right, now install the distro into your VM/HDD/SSD, it uses the Calamares installer, so head carefully


# Post-Install
- The first thing that you wish to do is update your system
sudo pacman -Syyu
- if the package manager fails to sync the base
sudo pamac update --force-refresh
- After updated, give an restart and see if everything is okay, at this point you are free to use the system however you like and wish
The reccomended is to explore the Big Store and the Control Center of Big Linux
Since it uses the KDE desktop enviroment, you can modify it outside of the proposed at Control Center
- It comes with Steam and Lutris, so gaming on is really easy, make sure you install Wine and Proton

# After Post-Install (Customization)
- You have 4 Start Menu options, hence them;
Cascade-based start menu
Full-Screen based start menu
BigLinux-style/modern start menu
KDE default start menu
- You can check the start button alternative logos right clicking the start button, there are many alternatives logos to be used

# Gaming
Since gaming is a one of the BigLinux's focus, you can configure Steam and Lutris, with possibility to install RetroArch, emulators, native games, with an rich and diverse Big Store
- Steam will be updated after launching, so its not full installed
- It's Arch/Manjaro based, so you will have most of the last technologies


The Big Linux's KDE feels more consistent and unique, so dont fear to learn the new KDE styling, here is an screenshot of my BigLinux install
